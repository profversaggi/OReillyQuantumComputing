*Thanks to Mariia at Microsoft for pointing out this one, and to Cláudio Gomes for additional correction!*

> **Incorrect**: "Any spy who tries to read one of these qubits has a <mark>25%</mark> chance of getting caught. So even if Alice and Bob only use 50 of them in the whole transfer, the spy’s chances of getting away are far less than one in a million."

> **Corrected**: "Any spy who tries to read one of these qubits has a <mark>12.5%</mark> chance of getting caught. So even if Alice and Bob only use 100 of them in the whole transfer, the spy’s chances of getting away are close to one in a million."
