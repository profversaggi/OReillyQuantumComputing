QCEngine
========

QCEngine is a quantum computer simulator accompanying the O'Reilly book `Programming Quantum Computers <https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Quantum-Computers-Essential-Algorithms/dp/1492039683>`_. Needing no installation, QCEngine makes use of the *circle notation* visualizations introduced in the book to provide a compelling pedagogical tool for learning to build quantum circuits.

This documentation provides an introduction to the syntax and nuances of the QCEngine simulator. Note that no discussion is provided here regarding the quantum computing background necessary for using this simulator. For this, we refer the user to `Programming Quantum Computers <https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Quantum-Computers-Essential-Algorithms/dp/1492039683>`_.

To get started with how to navigate and use the simulator, see the :ref:`quickstart <quickstart-label>`, or to quickly see a reference list of useful QCEngine commands see the :ref:`cheatsheet <cheatsheet-label>`. If you're new to JavaScript - the language used to access QCEngine commands - see our whistle-stop :ref:`introduction to JavaScript <javascript-label>`.
